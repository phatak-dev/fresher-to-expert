# Operating system

Writing my own operating system was always my dream. Operating system is the first level of software that talks to computer hardware. So its like the most important piece of software running on your laptop.

We all have studied operating system as course in our curriculum. Though it introduced the concepts like memory management, disk management etc we hardly can relate that knowledge with practically.

It will be great if you can see or build the pieces of operating system as you learn the concepts. It will be more awesome if the operating system is powerful enough like real operating system like Linux.


#Minix
Minix is an operating system created by Andrew S Tanenbaum , to teach operating system course. The lecturer created entire operating system just to teach the students the operating system. Since the operating system is inspired by Unix, most of the architecture and concepts are similar to Unix.


#Minix and Linux
Linus tornvald, the creator of Linux, was one the student who went through this course in university. He learn the basics of operating system from this course  and then applied to create Linux operating system. So you will learning from the book which Linus itself used to create Linux operating system


#Book

The book [Operating Systems Design and Implementation](http://www.amazon.com/Operating-Systems-Design-Implementation-Edition/dp/0131429388) contains explanation of each topic of operating system with complete source code in C. It's a big book but if you enough patience you can go through book with working examples in order to build your own operating system

So if you want to learn how a real operating system is built, go through this book and practice the code. By the end of the book you should have thorough understanding of the operating system.

# Language

You may have studied different computer languages like C, C++ in curriculum. You have used IDE, compiler, assembler to compile the source code to the machine code and run the program. Have you ever wanted to create your own computer language? If yes, then here is your opportunity.


#Why our own computer language
Computer languages are primarily the way we communicate with computer. Different languages have different characteristics. When we study them, initially they feel difficult to grasp. So we want to understand what it takes to create a good enough language from scratch. Creating our own language gives us the better understanding of existing computer languages and also adds powerful tool to our toolkit when we solve problems.

#Learning from the masters

The book you are going to use here is created by masters of the field. The book is written by  Brian W. Kernighan - creator of Unix, B language and Rob pike - one of the creator of Go language. Both have created the software that had endured many decades. So you are in good hands.


#Book

[Unix programming environment](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Environment-Prentice-Hall-Software-Series/dp/013937681X) is the one you should refer. If you have read earlier chapters you know that the book is already refrenced in the Read section. But for learning to create langugage you have to concentrate on last chapter of the book name "Programming environment"

In this long chapter, authors show how to create a C like programming language in under 3000 lines of C code. It's shows with right approach creating a programming language is not a big deal.

So go through this chapter from this book, by end of the chapter you will know how to create your own language.

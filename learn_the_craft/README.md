# Learn the craft

In last two sections we concentrated on the improving skills through by reading other's code, books and blogs. Reading is great but not enough. Until you code yourself and see the things by your own eye it will be not completely understood.

In this section, I am going to answer one of the common questions asked by many of just out of college professionals. "How the things I learnt in college relate to the real world problems?".

This section contains resource to build things from scratch. There will be books,courses and other resources which take to step by step building things.

These resources assume you know at least one computer programming language, know how to use cmd line, data structures and some basic knowledge of basics of algorithm. These resources take long time to master so take time and use them. If you use all of the resources in the chapter you will be more comfortable with your theoretical knowledge.

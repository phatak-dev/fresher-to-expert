# Nand to Tetris
Computer is a complex beast. It is made up of lots of moving parts. Right from basic logic gates to complex games like Counterstrike. You may have learnt gates, operating system , compiler etc etc in pieces. But have you ever wondered how all these pieces are put together to create an actual computer? If yes, then you should take this course where you build a computer from scratch

### Nand to Tetris

[Nand to Tetris](http://www.nand2tetris.org/) is a free course to build computer from first principles. The course comes with a book, software and source code to build things on your computer.Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlPj5Rg1y2w) video to get complete understanding of the course.

You will be starting to build computer from basic unit of any device, Nand gate. Moving forward you will build memory, processor and other hardware components.

Once hardware components are ready, then you will be starting to put together the software part of the equation like operating system, compiler and then designing a complete game on top of your own machine.

### Why Nand to tetris
Most of us are good in one aspect of development aka programming. But we lack knowledge of complete system. Having complete knowledge of the system makes our understanding of individual pieces more sound.

### Course contents

The following are the things you are going to learn

####Hardware

* Logic gates
* ALU/CPU
* Memory
* Computer Architecture
* Machine code


#### Software
 * Machine code
 * Assembler
 * Compiler
 * Virtual machine
 * Operating system
 * Your own programming language
 * Apps written in your language

If you see the topics, you may feel you already learn most of the topics. Yes you have!. The beauty of the course will teach how you can use all those topics put together to build a real machine.

### Have Patience
It takes time to build a computer. The course teachers says its 12 week course. It will take time to understand each and every concept. So dedicate some time to the course every day and build the machine over time. At the end of course you will be clear of most of the concepts that you learnt in college.

Happy time building :)

# Preface

Over the years, I have used different resources to become a good developer. These resources really helped me to transition from a clueless computer graduate student to competent developer.

So I have put together this book to help any student who out there wondering "How I improve my knowledge to become good developer?".

#Opinionated
This book is highly opinionated. Resources and advices shared here are what I think is the best. Not all going to agree on my point of view and that should be ok. There will be better resources or different ways to do the things.


# Audience
**This book is not how to**

 * Get good marks in Engineering exams
 * Get job in MNC
 * 24 hour guide to become successful

This book is written for the people who are passionate and want to become master in their craft.

### Youtube course vs MOOC

Unlike MOOC courses, youtube courses do not have any hands on or instructor feedback. They are just recording of the sessions inside the college. Though MOOC courses are superior than the Yotube one's, not every course is offered in MOOC format yet. So stick with Youtube courses till those courses come in MOOC format.


### Conference talks
Every year in different parts of the world many computer science conferences are held. It's almost impossible to attend all those conferences but don't worry most of the videos of these conferences are available on Youtube.

Conference talks are best way to learn the state of art technology from the best in field. Over the years many great videos have changed the way I think about the computing and programming. These talks are highly useful to improve the skills.

Following are the few talks to start with

* [Inventing on Principle](http://phatak-dev.github.io/techtalks/inventing-on-principle/)

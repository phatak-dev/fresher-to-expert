#Android vs iOS

Android and iOS two most famous smartphone operating system in market now. You may be wondering which phone you should get is it iPhone running iOS or phones running Android phones. Both phones have similar user facing characteristics but they have different level of control for developer.

iOS is based Mac operating system developed by Apple and Android is based Linux operating system. As we discussed in earlier chapter Linux is viable operating system for Desktop for a developer and its same for phone too. So if you want tinker with phone like you with your computer, I recommend you to go with Android.

#Why Android ?
The following are few reasons you should pickup Android as you smartphone.

* ###Linux based

    Android is based on linux. It follows similar conventions for file system, process management etc like Ubuntu or any other linux based computer operating system. So its like you running linux carrying with you.

* ### Open source

  Android is open source. This means you can look at the code and try to learn how a mobile operating system works. Not only you can poke around code, if you feel adventurous you can create your custom operating system from this source code like thousands of other developer does. One of most famous custom ROM is [Cynogenmod](http://www.cyanogenmod.org/). Here thousands of developers collaborate and create their own version of Android flavor. You can join them too

* ### Apps

One of the great things about the Smartphone they come with lot of great applications. It's also true in Android. You great apps on phone. Some of must have apps are

* [Feedly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devhd.feedly) - Now you can read news where you are
* [Pocket](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ideashower.readitlater.pro) - Read it later on phone
* [Calendar](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.calendar) - Keep track of all your appointments
* [Google Keep](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep) - Todo app


If you see the apps mentioned above, all the apps are highly useful to keep track of news and work right on the phone. They sync seamless on web so you don't have put info multiple times.

* ### Java based Application development

Using other apps is good. But how about writing your own App? that's going to be awesome. One of the good thing about Android uses standard language like Java and tools like Eclipse, Idea for mobile application development. Most of these tools you already know from previous sections, which means you already capable of building apps for your phone. Learn how [here](http://developer.android.com/)

#Which Android phone to Buy?

Now you know the value of owning a Android smartphone, you may wondering what phone you should buy. People consider lot of things when they phone right from price to camera quality. So the recommendation here done only on developer friendliness. Normally I want to an Android phone which

* Runs stock Android
* Should be update to newer OS
* Should support custom ROM like Cynogenmod
* Easy to customize both in OS and apps
* Good developer community support

As you see I have no say on hardware features and price range. That all is up to you. But if you want to own a great developer friendly phone I recommend you [Google Nexus](http://www.google.com/nexus/) series phones.

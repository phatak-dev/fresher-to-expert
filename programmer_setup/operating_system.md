# Operating system
Operating system is the most critical piece of computer system. Having a good operating system makes development much easier. Normally most of the computers run Windows operating system. It's good for most of casual users of the computers. But as a developer, you have better choices. If you are using Windows consider switching to Linux based operating system.

#Why Linux?
Linux systems come with many important advantages over windows for power user. As a developer you should be power user of the operating system. The following are few of the reasons why you should adopt linux

* ###It's Unix based

    Unix is famous for its simplicity and robustness. As Linux is based on Unix you will get similar robustness and simplicity out of the box. No more random crashes or hangup. Linux also has awesome security which means no worries of viruses.

* ### Operating system course teaches you Linux

    All the concepts in operating system course are based on linux operating system. So if you want to understand shell, process management, file system , inode number etc its better to use Linux. In linux you can see all these concepts hands on which makes your understanding much better.

*   ### Most servers run Linux

    Most of the server programming , like Web programming, network programming is done in Linux. Most of the website in world uses linux to host and run their sites. So if you want to learn all about network programming or server side development linux is the ideal option.

* ###Free

    Linux is free to use. So if you use linux on your machine you don't have to pay any money. If you are using pirated Windows stop using it. Switch to Linux you will get operating system for free without stealing.

* ### Great development support

    Developing programs in linux is like dream. Linux supports C development out of the box. You can develop Java,python or any other language programs very easily on the linux. So as a developer you get excellent support from the operating system to the programming.


#But Linux is command line right?
This is one of misconception about Linux. In earlier days linux only used to come with command line interfaces. But with newer distribution of linux like Ubuntu you get nice GUI like you find on windows.

#Ubuntu - Linux distribution for beginners
There are many distributions of linux available. You may be heard of Redhat, Fedora,Ubuntu etc. If you only used windows till now and want to make a switch to Linux, I recommend you to start with [Ubuntu](www.ubuntu.com). Ubuntu is very easy to use and well supported operating system. It's also choice of operating of mine.So you can start with ubuntu and as you become more comfortable with linux you can move into other distributions.



#I have windows, can I tryout linux without partitioning?
Yes of course. Before you make up mind to use Linux as daily operating system you can try out using virtualbox. Find more about how to install Ubuntu on virtualbox refer [this](http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Ubuntu-on-VirtualBox) article.


#Power of command line
Ubuntu comes with nice GUI. You can use ubuntu like Windows just by using GUI only. But the real power of linux comes from command line. Many developers fear the command line when they use first time. But please don't give up. Able to use command line gives you power over other normal programmer. Command line allows you automate lot of routinely things. So I highly recommend you spend lot of time on Ubuntu command line. You will find it's power after sometime.
